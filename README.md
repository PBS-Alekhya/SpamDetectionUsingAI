# Spam Detection Using AI

# Project Overview
This project is a production-grade, containerized microservice that classifies text-based inputs (such as posts or comments) as "spam" or "not_spam" with a confidence score. The microservice is fully offline, built with FastAPI, and follows strict REST API standards.

It is specifically trained on Indian context data, including WhatsApp-style text, Hinglish, and regional scam patterns.
